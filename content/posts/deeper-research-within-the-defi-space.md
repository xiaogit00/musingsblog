After a two month break from Defi to build my investment tracking application, I am back in the game. This time, I'd very much want to understand Defi on a deeper level. Defi, of course, is a sprawling discipline. In its current state, it is getting slightly closer to formalization - however, much of the technology is still experimental in nature and many projects are still 'ongoing tests in production'. When I approached it two months back, I developed a high level understanding of the different kinds of services and protocols available within Defi - but there are still many gaps.

In the next few weeks, I plan to go deeper into some of the topics that have confused me in the past and hopefully arrive at deeper insight into some of them.

List of topics in line:

1. State of Layer 2s
2. The effects of impermanent loss for Liquidity providers on different Dexs.
3. Oracles
4. On the idea of retroactive public goods
