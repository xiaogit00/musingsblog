So I've decided to revive this project after a long while haha. What exactly is this project? Idk, technical writing, as well as sporadic posts about life. I have a substack, but that's a little more for polished posts about general topics in life, whereas this one is for rough sketches of everything I find interesting, as well as an online documentation of my journey with certain things. 

And, as the current domain name suggests, I am officially in my deep learning phase in my life, and I want to carve out a space to write about everything that I learn on that front. 

For there are tonnes of things to document and talk about. 

The last url was musingsondefi. It was created during a time where I was in the crypto space - well, technically, I still am, but honestly, I have pretty much checked out. I am currently in the blockchain industry, yes, but the company is more like selling a SaSS product - a crypto SaSS product that's built on the contemporary tech stack and blockchain is one part of it. 

But I feel like that phase of my life is ending. I have stopped becoming interested in crypto a long time ago. So here's to a new journey with deep learning, the technology that will definitely change the world in the next few years to come.
