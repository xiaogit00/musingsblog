That's it - I am done with sitting on the sidelines. Im confident that with my current level of skills and knowledge, Im finally able to begin making some power moves with substantial money (for my standards).

All good moves comes from thinking hard about strategy and moving fast and decisively when you spot an attractive position based on your evaluation.

My previous approach has been the cautious one because I realized that the pond is deep and there's too many ways to lose your money here.

But right now, the pond seems manageable to swim in, which means I need to begin exploring every possible corner.

I need a change of modus operandi.

This time, I'll learn by having skin in the game.

There's a 10k USD fund that I've set aside to really dive deep in this pool, with the sole target of: being an early adopter of 10 different protocols that I feel are going to be game changers, and growing this fund to 20k through activity on these protocols.

With each protocol that I invest in, I would need to do a thorough deep dive on it, as well as see what kind of potential it has for me.

Let's see where I end up.

The first things on my list is to really explore more DAPPs on the Polygon Ecosystem & Layer 2s like Arbitrum, as well as Terra.

First, I'll need to fully familiarize myself with the bluechips.

Then, I'll need to identify and explore the newer protocols.

I'll take this 10k as fund that I m willing to lose, as the risks for not knowing the game is higher than this 10k alone.

Jom.
