One quip I've heard made in a podcast recently is that if you're just following the trends of SNP500, you're not getting a complete picture of the market. The reason is because, Covid has produced particular market dynamics that have impacted different segments of the market differently.

So in this post, let's take a look at how different individual stocks within the SNP500 has performed, starting with the top 25 in terms of weight.

## 1. Microsoft

Well, the story of Microsoft does seem like the story of SNP. The last ten years has been phenomenal for this tech giant.

Prices rose from around $20 in 2012 to $288 in 2021 - a 14x return.

In the last few weeks, prices fell from $340 to $296 (15%).

This is a significant correction.

## AAPL

Within the last 10 years, Apple shares also saw meteoric growth. Specifically, AAPL prices more than doubled within the last two years alone, which corresponds with MSFT's picture.

Since Jan this year, we see AAPL fall from ATH of $181 to $162 (11%).

## Amazon

A similar pattern emerges with Amazon.

AMZN's fall has been very drastic. It fell by 29% since ATH of 3692 in October last year.


## Tesla

Tesla is a weird one. It has experienced hyper growth, and is also a bit of a meme stock. Tesla basically 5xed since the start of Covid.

TSLA Stock has fallen 27% as well.

## GOOGL
Google stock did not fall so much - 14%.

## FB
Fallen from ATH of $380 to around $300 - a 26% fall.

## Berkshire Hathaway
Interestingly, BRK-B hasn't fallen so much - only a 5% fall.

## JP Morgan
Fell quite sharply within the last week - a 17% fall.

## Home Depot
Fell by 18%.

## Johnson and Johnson
![]()
Not so drastic - 4%.

## Procter and Gamble

Not much. 3%.

## Bank of America
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dl4murstw/image/upload/v1643000438/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_1.00.32_PM_hgmwkp.png)
Not much: 9%.

## Adobe
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dl4murstw/image/upload/v1643000409/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_1.00.06_PM_mocroa.png)
Adobe fell drastically - 38%.

## Netflix

Blood on the streets - 27% fall. But to be fair, the last mile pump was inflated to begin with.

## SalesForce

A 41% fall.

## Disney
A 45% fall from ATH.

So in terms of the hardest hit stocks within SNP, it does seem to be Tech stocks.

Netflix leading with 73% fall from ATH, followed by the likes of Disney, Adobe, or SalesForce at ~ 45%. They belong to the mid cap tech stocks.

Needless to say, I could imagine the small caps to have taken a bloodbath. I'll need to examine that in more detail.

FAANG stocks have taken a moderate hit at around the 15% mark, with the exeception of Amazon which already fell by 29%.

Within economic crashes, it is not uncommon for individual stocks to go down by 70% or more, especially if it is a growth stock.

Stocks that have weathered the storm well seem to be Health related stocks such as PnG or JnJ, along with the likes of Berkshire.

Even Costco saw a 17% fall.

Capital is most definitely risk off for now.

## Paypal
Paypal has taken a drastic hit from last year June onwards, from $307 ATH to $162 now.

## WMT
Walmart has been holding on really well.

Barely a dip.

## Qualcomm
14% fall.

## Morgan Stanley
6% fall.

## Conclusion

Overall, the US markets have seen a period of astonishing growth. Inflation figures are currently at 7% and we'll most likely expect a downturn coming. Several areas, such as the growth stocks as well as Fintech, have already taken the hit. We'd expect the fall to be rather drastic for most of them.

The general projection for SNP500 is also likely to be down severely.
