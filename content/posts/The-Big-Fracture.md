<!-- To talk about: 
- The fracturing of the social media landscape 
- We're living in the in-between era 
- Big problems with social media -> disinformation and informational warfare 
- algorithms that fuel collective outrage instead of meaningful discourse 
- effects on mental health 
-> the paradox of network effect - to get big, you must have a winning algorithm; yet, to win, it needs to tap into the latent powers of virality 
- Yet, we need to stay connected - the public square will and must exist

Modeling a better social media 
- - what are some of the technical requirements or specs of a new form of social media that is devoid of all these effects? 
- how do we solve the problem of disinformation? Can videos/photos be GPS source tagged? Or validated? Are there photos that are verified true and unaltered? 
-

I have not been using social media for a while now. Facebook has long ran its course, Instagram has become a glitzy ad factory filled with occassional uninteresting life updates from friends, X (formerly Twitter) is being run to the ground by Elon Musk, Threads feels like a copycat without a soul, and Tik Tok has not really caught on for people of my generation. It is 2023, and it feels like we've reached [a moment of fragmentation](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/3/23782607/social-web-public-apps-end-reddit-twitter-mastodon). If the decade from 2010 to 2020 was the consolidation era for Facebook and Instagram, 2023 is the year things come apart. Like the transition period between MySpace and Tumblr, we're living in a cusp. 

In the last 13 years - can you believe it, social media, at scale, has only been around for 13 years? - it feels like we have collectively gotten ourselves entirely enmeshed in it, witnessed its joys and frivolities, felt the pulsing powers of connection and dopamine, instant gratification and validation, experienced the subtle but pernicious effects on our psyches, self-esteem, and conception of the social, viewed the world through it, collectively organized and channeled our outrage and emotions, and eventually realizing how utterly flawed the entire model is as we dealt with echo chambers and bi-polarization and fake news. Social media is messy because we are messy. The last decade was truly the first decade in human history where *everyone was online*. We've had our fun, but now it seems like we've also sobered up to so many of its downsides. Whilst not quitting entirely, we've very much tempered our useage.
