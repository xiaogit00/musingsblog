Consider the Handdrill.

P1: Introduction to the problem.
-Handdrill - a handy tool that costs around a $100, that many people might need for *some* time, but for most of its shelf life, it lies dormant in someone's shed or toolbox.

- For one of its most common use case - drilling some holes into the wall to put up some picture frame - it is relatively expensive to buy, yet impossible to do the job without.

- items like these have *high rental value* - meaning that these things are expensive, use cases are one off, and it doesn't make sense to own it for a long period of time for most people.

- Yet, the rental market for these items are highly inefficient. If you're an owner of a good hand drill, you'll probably want to rent it out for *some* amount of money rather than have it lay dormant, but is afraid that 1) what if someone runs off with it? 2) what if it's damaged by an irreponsible user? Who covers for that?

- In other words, you need reassurance that your item will not be lost or damaged. At any point in which the risks of the above nature outweighs the returns from renting it out, it does not make economic sense to proceed with the rent.

- In traditional rental markets such as cars, these risks are typically born by borrowers (and/or their insurers) through a contractually binding damage policy. The role of centralized rental platforms is to mediate and absorb those risks on behalf of asset *lenders* through a combination of enforcement resources and/or insurance policy.

- But what if those very same risks could be partially or at least substantially managed through a combination of insurance, smart contracts, and IoT technology?

- Let's imagine what such a system would entail.
