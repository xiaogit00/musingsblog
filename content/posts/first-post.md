Okay where was I. Yesterday I was just reading more about different platforms, until I realized that I am not absorbing anything anymore, and that the only way to get better at the game and to fully appreciate the nuances is to participate and be a player in the game. However, the game is fairly disadvantageous for small time players who just want to experiment.

So.

I would need to break down my inquiry into different problem sets. I think trading problem #1 gives me quite a good way into the game, allowing me to do a comparison between different yielding mechanisms and analyze its projected returns.

So why not continue with it?

So far, I've established that one of the worst ways to 'invest' is to put it into liquidity pools. The returns are shit.

Looking at the top trending liquidity pools, the ones with 800% APY are those obscure tokens I've never heard about.

This is essentially how you attract liquidity and drive usage to your coin nowadays - you pump up the yield to get degen farmers buying your coin, and subsequently, the degen farmers are most likely left with fewer percentage of the less valuable coin, and more of the shit coin.

Which brings me to a sub-research question. What determines the yield on liquidity pools? Why are some yield pools 800% and some 2%? How does a shitcoin protocol 'game' the system by driving up yield for adoption?

Instead of finding out the answers myself, perhaps now I am going to tap on the wisdom of the community. Enter Discord.
