So, I've been setting up some traffic filters on Google Analytics for this site, and I realized once again that I've forgotten everything about IP addresses :blush:

Not getting too much into detail, but the basic observation that I've made is that everything coming from my house network has a particular IP address: 220.255.xx.xxx.

And my Xiaomi phone 3G has another IP address: 111.61.xx.xxx.

When I switched my Xiaomi wifi on, it displays 220.255 again.

An IP is the same across a particular router network. Great.
