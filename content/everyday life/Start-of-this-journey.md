So yes, an update - I'll be beginning my role as a developer advocate for Covalent. It's termed developer relations internally (and externally) because the word advocate or evangelism is probably not *objective sounding* enough, which of course isn't great. But I'd like to think of it as advocate because relations is a bit soft - no, I am not just building relations with you, I am trying to *convince* you of something.


But in any case, the objectives are the same. Bring about more awareness of the benefits of Covalent to the developer community, and either resolving issues for them, or, taking their feedback internally to build a better product.

The task, then, is simple. First, I need to know how to use Covalent's product inside out, preferably from different angles/use cases/ sub-industries within Crypto. The best way to do that is to actually build products using Covalent's API.

Second, I need to be close to the developers. Answering their questions, guiding them through, aiding them with their requests, figuring out their painpoints from their point of view.

Third - and this is an important add on - understand what Covalent API *doesn't* do and what other products in the market fill its role.

Forth - understanding the scale at which developers are using other products, and asking why.

All my efforts in the first few months need to be aligned to these goals, arranged in order of importance.
